# Sega Paradise 2

This project is a react app that a reimagining of the original [Sega Paradise](https://segaparadise.herokuapp.com/) web app.

## What is it and How Does it Work
Similar to the previous project, it is site dedicated to my love of the Sega Genesis console. The user is still provided 16 games, but the user does not have CRUD capabilities. That is replaced via the use of the Giant Bomb API. Each game still has a page dedicated to providing the user with data about the game. This time around, the focus was on overall design. The app is broken up into two sections: mobile and laptop/hd/4K. The design (similar to the previous one) is influenced by the outrun aesthetic. Outrun pulls its style and namesake from the 1986 Sega arcade game. My intent was to convey that style via SASS and I believe I accomplished that. Please feel free to see for yourself by click the link at the top of this page. Thanks
